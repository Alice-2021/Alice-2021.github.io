<h1>Weight Placement</h1>
<p> It is crucial to have your body in the right place at all points of a roll tack. The main force moving the boat during a roll tack is yourself. You want your body as close to the bow as possible with your legs still in the hole. You do not want to be past the mast. Your leg closer to the stern should be on the other side of the hiking strap, and the opposite for your other foot. When you start to see the sail luff, you want to thrust your shoulders outside the boat so that you feel as if the boat will capsize. A laser requires a lot of core, so you will reach up with your core, grab the other side of the boat with your mainsheet hand, and flip your body around. You will then make sure the boat is flat, and be on the new tack. Here is an image of a person going into a roll tack. </p>
